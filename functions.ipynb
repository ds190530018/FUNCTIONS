What is the difference between a function and a method in Python?\n","\n","-  Function: A function is defined using the def keyword and exists independently. It is not tied to any object or class.\n","\n","- Method: A method is a function that is defined inside a class and is associated with an object  of that class. Methods typically take self as their first parameter to access instance data.\n","\n","\n","\n","QUS2. Explain the concept of function arguments and parameters in Python.\n","- In Python, parameters are the variables listed in the function definition, while arguments are the values passed to the function when it is called.\n","\n","\n","\n","QUS3.  What are the different ways to define and call a function in Python?\n","- In Python, we can define a function using the def keyword, and call it by specifying its name. we can also use the lambda keyword to define an anonymous function.\n","\n","\n","\n","QUS4.  What is the purpose of the `return` statement in a Python function?\n","- The return statement in Python ends a function and sends back a value to the caller. It is  used to return the result of a function's operations.\n","\n","\n","QUS5. What are iterators in Python and how do they differ from iterables?\n","-  An  iterator is an object that lets you loop through iterable objects like lists, tuples, sets, and dictionaries\n","\n","on the other hand\n","- In Python, an iterable is an object that can be looped over, or iterated through, one element at a time.\n","\n","\n","\n","QUS6.  Explain the concept of generators in Python and how they are defined.\n","- A generator function is the type of function that returns an iterator object. Instead of using return to send back a single value, generator functions use yield to produce a series of results over time.\n","\n","\n","\n","QUS7. What are the advantages of using generators over regular functions?\n","- Generators provide a space-efficient method and flexibility for such data processing as only parts of the file are handled at one given point in time\n","\n","\n","\n","QUS8.  What is a lambda function in Python and when is it typically used?\n","-   it is a small, anonymous function that's defined in a single line. It's used for short-term operations that don't require a full function definition.\n","\n","\n","\n","QUS9.  Explain the purpose and usage of the `map()` function in Python.\n","- it execute a specified function for each pf the item of an iterable.\n","\n","\n","QUS10. . What is the difference between `map()`, `reduce()`, and `filter()` functions in Python?\n","\n"," -  MAP Applies a given function to each item of an iterable (e.g., list, tuple) and returns a new iterable (a map object).\n","\n"," -Reduces an iterable to a single cumulative value by repeatedly applying a given function. Unlike map() and filter(), reduce() is part of the functools module.\n","\n"," - Filters elements in an iterable based on whether they satisfy a condition defined by a given function. The function must return True or False.\n","\n","\n"," QUS11.
